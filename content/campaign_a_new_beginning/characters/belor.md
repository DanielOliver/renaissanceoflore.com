Belor joined the Dwarven Military at an early age and distinguished himself in defense of his homeland, and in Dwarven wars for expansion. After seeing many of his friends die in a large battle against an orcish incursion, he turned to religion and became an acolyte of Clangeddin Silverbeard, the Dwarven god of war.

Continuing to serve in this new role, Belor was granted the rank of alaghor in Clangeddin's priesthood, a position for leaders in battle. He was attached to the famed Dwarven 1st Spear, an elite scouting unit, and grew in fame as their chaplain as well as a keen strategist.

After decimating an invasion of Gnolls that was threatening the Dwarven homeland, the 1st Spear was disbanded and its members spread between other units due to their increasing popularity and fears from Dwarven politicians that their power and popularity was growing too great. Belor decided to take this time to muster out and see the world he had so long fought to defend.
