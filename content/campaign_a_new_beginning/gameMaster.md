These are the known intents, style, and musings by the Game Master (or Dungeon Master, GM, DM) of the campaign A Past and Future Secret. These musings derive most of the thoughts from the [inspirations](#inspirations) listed below.

### Mechanics and Style

<br/>

* Dice rolls should not always be strictly followed. As appropriate, the DM may fudge the dice rolls so long as the players don't catch them doing so. An example of an appropriate scenario is to avoid a Total Party Kill where party revival/capture/imprisonment would not make any sense. This point is not always popular, but I'm not always good at estimating difficulty and so this is a fallback option.
* To prevent the party from stalling out in discussion, I'll add some timers. These timers could be real or not. One example of a fake timer is tapping dice or metallic objects together behind the DM screen in the rhythm of footsteps. One example of a real timer could be cries for help from an innocent NPC or a bureaucrat poking their nose into the party's business, depends on the session.
* Whenever a player starts losing interest in the current scene and the player starts doing some random actions on the side, I try to write it down. The consequences of the player's goofing around might come back to bite them later. This is also a hint to me that I need to get the scene moving forward.
* I'm not trying to create a quiz show where the players will be asking the NPCs questions. I am trying to create a talk show where the player characters are interacting with each other, sharing their viewpoints, and building a worldview based on what they have in common. Relatively little information should be required to spark a player character commentating panel.
* Monologuing NPCs and villains shouldn't give a lot of dense information. By the time the monologue is over, the players will have forgotten all but one idea from that speech. At most one or two ideas will remain after any speech, but all the audience will really remember is how you made them feel. Hopefully the villain strikes fear instead of boredom.
* I believe in that concept of multiple fail states. A character's failure should have multiple levels, and then subsequent actions can either decrease or increase the failed state. An example could be a failure by a firbolg to evade a grappling goblin. The goblin is unlikely to entirely restrain a firbolg, but perhaps the goblin is hanging off an arm rendering the arm useless in combat. The firbolg can try to shake the goblin off, but if the firbolg fails, perhaps the goblin climbs higher towards the firbolg's head. There are many ways that failure can happen, and so if there's possibilities between utter success and utter failure, try them out.

### NPCs

<br/>

A NPC (Non-Player-Character) is how the Dungeon Master interacts with the players in game. The Dungeon Master plays each of these NPCs.

I have no reliable way to predict what NPCs that the players will love and will want to ally with or will hate and want to destroy. The best I can do is to try to make characters memorable, which brings me to the hardest part for me: my voice does not have a wide range. So instead of using voices to make a NPC memorable, I try to give them noticeable names, descriptions, mannerisms, catch-phrases, idiosyncrasies, and attitudes.

The NPCs I create are initially categorized into several variations: world-building flavor, deep-motive, and informant. The NPCs can then evolve or devolve into another variant as the players make choices.

* An informant NPC is a character that is there for the players to get information from. An example could be a character that gives a quest, a captured enemy, or an innkeeper.
* A world-building flavor NPC is a character that is there to give the players the impression that this world is real. An example could be a street vendor selling food, a farmer tilling his field, a kid playing in front of a house, or a random goblin in a cave.
* A deep-motive NPC is a character that is there with the intent for the players to dig deeper into what the NPC wants. Clues should be given so that the players question what the character wants or is trying to do. I derive a mean joy from hearing the players come up with some hypothesis and then the character doing something else and making the players question their findings.

### Combat Encounters

<br/>

I've started following these simple rules for combat encounters as I go:

1. I, the DM, should not be playing many NPCs on the players' side. *The number of actions that the DM is making as allied NPCs should not exceed the players' actions.* The DM is not here to fight the player's battles.
2. The players cannot talk their way out of every battle because not every NPC is willing to change their ways. Just because some bard walks in doesn't mean years of life-values for a character are going to change.
3. Most combat encounters should generally have less enemies than the player count and the enemies should be a greater level in order to balance the encounter. My motivation here is to limit the downtime between player's turns. By limiting the number of turns being taken each round, the entire encounter should be shorter and more content can be fit in a session. And by minimizing time between player's turns, the players should be kept more interested. As for balancing, see the "action economy":  _The economy of actions is the sum total of actions a group of PCs have compared to that of the monsters they face._ [-Sly Flourish][4]
4. If feasible, a physical or visual encounter map should be provided.
5. I prefer to give low armor to monsters. Players don't get a lot of turns in a typical encounter and so I want them to feel strong and powerful. If we're creating a story, missing over half of the attacks should be rare, and then when such failure happens it should be a noteworthy story event.

### Inspirations

* [Matt Colville][0] for his excellent thoughts about running games.
* [Critical Role][1] for getting our group into Dungeons & Dragons.
* [The Monsters Know What Theyâ€™re Doing][2] for teaching me as a Dungeon Master how to add more variety into combat encounters.
* [Sir Terry Pratchett][3] for being one of my favorite authors and an absolute inspiration to much of this story world's ideas. And I sometimes panic and use names from the Discworld books when my players catch me with an unexpected need for a name.
* [Sly Flourish][5] for lots of miscellaneous thoughts and concepts.
