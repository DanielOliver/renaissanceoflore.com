. The drow lady summons a bat-like fey demon known as a Bucca. Agnes is knocked unconscious and then saved by Belor. The heroes kill the persistent and fanatically loyal ruffians. 

The heroes loot the ruffians and find little of interest beyond a figurine seemingly tied to the now-unaligned Bucca wandering around that they feed soup to and adopt.

Gracchus learns to speak Abyssal from a book titled "Learn Abyssal in Three Days or Your Demon Back" stolen from the wizard Probabilitor's apartments.
