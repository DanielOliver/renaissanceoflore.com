During breakfast the next day at the Sunken Norwegian Tavern, the entire party is accosted by a bureaucratic, stuffy, pencil-pusher gnome and her name is Anselm Rodric. She is from the city government’s department of city planning and is on the hunt for the plumber’s guild who must register, pay a fee, and other legal busywork. The party tells her to attribute the guild to Beckett Sunfounder and look to Beckett for the guild’s founding fee of 20 gold.
