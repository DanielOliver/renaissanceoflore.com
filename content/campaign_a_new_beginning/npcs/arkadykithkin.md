A few of the other heroes go furniture shopping with Goblin Wick at the Tomracine Kithkinâ€™s Homegrown Furniture Emporium. Arkady Kithkin is the Firbolg family member on duty at the moment. Mike buys himself a large chest for storage. The others pool some money and buy a formal desk and chair to serve as the front office of the guild.
