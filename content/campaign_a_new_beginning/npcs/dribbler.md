Tall for a ratman (normally 3’3”) by being nearer 4 feet tall. Very thin and scrawny, as though under-nourished.  Smells like the city dump, which Dribbler spends some time scavenging in.

High pitched cackle and obsequious attitude. More than willing to be a sycophant in return for promises of future favor and future riches. Willing to lie in order to tell anyone what they want. Often shows up at public events hauling a small cart full of cooking meats and pastries, a captive market is the best market.
