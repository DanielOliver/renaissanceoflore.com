On the roof is a lean-to encampment that conceals a cloaked shape. When questioned, this cloaked figure identified itself as Frogface the Enlightened, whereupon Mike threw it off the roof and threw its stuff off too. Agnes rushed down to the street and helped this member of the Folk of Leng collect her belongings. Belor heals Frogface’s hurt leg and cordial talks resume. The heroes determine they need a secretary to answer the guild’s visitors while they do hero stuff, so they set up chairs and start interviewing Frogface on the street.  Frogface the Enlightened answers most questions with “I am Frogface the Enlightened” and subtly reveals she is a lady of the night. The heroes hire her as a secretary and lookout, with promises of wages and of allowing continued residence on their rooftop.
