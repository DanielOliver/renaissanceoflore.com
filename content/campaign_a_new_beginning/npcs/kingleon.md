The entire party casts about for a new trail to follow now that the Redcap’s trail has ended. They find a smaller and much lighter trail of footprints that continue leading east towards a squat stone building in the distance. Cletus also interrogates a crocodile, some lizards, snakes, and birds nearby who confirm that a child with red hair has gone by and that the squat stone building is new. The crocodile’s name is King Leon, and the crocodile mentions the Snake Underground but which particular snake or snakes that refers to is vague.
