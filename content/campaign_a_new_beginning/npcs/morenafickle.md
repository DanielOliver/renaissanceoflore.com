A spectator in the next room laughs at the hero’s antics. This spectator is a blue-ish tint, slim, with very lean muscles, wearing pants and a leather apron, holding a straight-edge razer. The heroes have enough knowledge and magic detection to realize he’s a Vile Barber from the fey realm. Vile Barbers are usually more suited to cities and to cutting throats in dark alleys than to temples in a marsh and so finding him here is a bit of a surprise.
