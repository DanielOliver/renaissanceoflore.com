The heroes interrogate the wizard and find out that he was running out of the feywild, specifically in fear from the temple’s patron who is a beautiful lady. The heroes decide that confronting the temple patron isn’t a good idea and elect to not enter the feywild portal. The wizard’s name is mentioned as Probabilitor.

The magical trail leads to the servant’s entrance of the wizard guild located in Caladan Town’s Inner City. The heroes gain entrance to the wizard’s guild on the pretense that they bear a gift of the bat figurine for Wizard Probabilitor.  The second floor is where Probabilitor’s apartments are, the second floor being where all the conjurist’s apartments are. Instead of finding the wizard, the heroes find the Vile Barber from the temple that they ruined sitting on the couch. Thinking back, the heroes remember that the wizard went into the fey portal and then came running out a bit later, and that was probably when the identity theft occurred.

The Vile Barber has stolen the identity of the wizard Probabilitor and those who know in the wizard’s guild don’t care so long as the Vile Barber votes with them in the wizard’s guild.
