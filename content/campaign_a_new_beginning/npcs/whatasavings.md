Soothing voice with a persuasive tilt that sounds exactly like a noblewoman of a great house, very out of type with appearance. Easily tricked into buying goods that can never be sold elsewhere. Tends to steal anything not locked up, on the basis that it’s “just laying about”. Haughty and mildly arrogant.
