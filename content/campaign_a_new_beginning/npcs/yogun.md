Upon finding the Sunken Norwegian, the heroes experience doubt at the structural integrity of the tavern which is four stories tall, and each story looks to be larger and more unsound than the previous, with the fourth floor being a series of tent shanties. The heroes barrage the apparent proprietor, an old barmaid named Yogun, with requests for room, beer, and knowledge. The heroes get the rooms and the beer.
