A past and future secret rulings, both by the dungeon master and by the house.

* A spell that requires a _common_ material element will not be required. A competent spellcaster will be assumed to carry all the tricks of the trade. If a spell requires an amount of gold or a _rare_ material, then those requirements will remain. This ruling is suspended if a character is stripped of all material possessions by circumstances, in which case the Dungeon Master (DM) may require those resources at their discretion.
* The daily requirements of eating and taking the necessary will be streamlined over unless relevant to plot.
