A Past and Future Secret campaign's rulings are shown here. The rules are either by the Game Master (or Dungeon Master, GM, DM) or by the house.

* A spell that requires a _common_ material element will not be required. A competent spellcaster will be assumed to carry all the tricks of the trade. If a spell requires an amount of gold or a _rare_ material, then those requirements will remain. This ruling is suspended if a character is stripped of all material possessions by circumstances, in which case the Game Master may require those resources at their discretion.
* The daily requirements of eating and taking the necessary will be streamlined over unless relevant to plot.
* The inspiration mechanic is in use.
* Plot Points: each session a player accumulates one "Plot Point". A Plot Point may be spent by a player at any point in the game to change the narrative of the story. An example could be a player saying "Plot Point! There's a magic fountain in this room that is filled with ale!" The Game Master has the option to either veto the Plot Point outright, or to let it continue growing. A Plot Point grows by then having the next player on the right pass to the right or by giving a twist to the Plot Point, for example "But anyone who drinks from that magic fountain can only speak in Goblin for the next three days.".  The original player may then ask for another twist from the next player in line on the right (and this may continue repeatedly) or veto it or ask the GM to accept it. If the Plot Point is vetoed by the Game Master, the player doesn't lose their Plot Point. There is no limit to the number of Plot Points that a player may accumulate.
* Homebrew anything can be accepted at the Game Master's approval. Every class, every race, everything is up for negotiation.
* A player may request for their character to be "retired" if they wish to make a new character. Any retirement is final and subject to the Game Master's mercy.
* Natural 20 "critical rolls" only count in combat. A natural 20 in any other situation is just a really good roll, that probably means something good but isn't a guarantee.
