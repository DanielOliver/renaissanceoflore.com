In the throne room is two thrones, one greater and one lesser, a translucent portal presumably to the Fey realm, and a set of pillars that march down either side of the room. The depictions of the man on either side of the stone walls is now identical and shows a ritual or spell being recited from a book and then the man kneeling. On the lesser throne sits a grey-beard wizard chanting and apparently holding open the portal with his concentration.  The hag and the stone people block the entrance with the heroes in the middle of the room.  

The green swamp hag expresses more and more desperation to achieve a resolution and then squeals and runs away from the entrance with the stone people following her. Some booming noise is coming from the entrance. 

The booming noises were the exaggerated steps of a piratey looking fellow named Finnick Dunbar. “I’m just looking for rum and gold, don’t mind me, unless you have rum and gold?” 

At this time, there’s a five-way standoff: the wizard on the lesser throne, the Vile Barber ostensibly working for the Wizard but still possessing the halfling child, the unknown Finnick Dunbar, the Hag and her stone people, and the heroes. 

Mike loses his cool a little bit and fires an arrow at the hag, but failed to notice that Agnes was in the way. Mike’s arrow hits Agnes in the side and Mike starts acting like he’s on the Hag’s side. The battle lines are drawn and most of the party and even Finnick just goes for the Hag trying to circumvent the stone people. Mike tries to jump over the stone people and ends up being held by a stone person at which time the Hag welcomes her new friend. 

The Hag makes Rubik’s cube solving motions with her hands and tosses finger bones and other unidentified bones on the floor. Agnes tries to catch the Vile Barber in possession of the halfling child, but the barber slips into the shadows and hides. Enraged at this, Agnes uses an axe to attack a face imprinted on a cobblestone on the floor. The attack on the floor does an inordinate amount of damage creating a large slightly-sloping depression on the floor, very wide and very shallow. The bones thrown by the Hag roll to the center of the indent. 

By now the heroes have hurt the Hag deeply and the green blood flows forth and starts slowly flowing down the mild slope, also towards the center of the indent. The Hag and the protective screen of stone people are running as fast as they can towards the portal. Mike had escaped the stone person’s grasp. As the Hag runs, she takes out two green caps similar to the Redcaps from before and soaks them in her blood with her dying breaths. Upon the Hag’s death, the stone people freeze in place and the Hag dissolves into green blood that flows towards the indent in the floor. Seeing this sight, Agnes removes the finger bones from the indent in the floor as a preventative measure against unknown magic. From the green caps form two Greencaps very similar to the previous Redcap encountered. 

Gracchus puts a sword through the neck of one of the Greencaps and removes half the neck, but the body takes slightly longer to stop moving. The other Greencap is also quickly dispatched.  

The Vile Barber abandons the halfling child next to the portal now that the Hag is dead and the Vile Barber disappears. Cletus throws his pet familiar opossum “Paw Paw” towards the child with intent to comfort. “Nice kitty cat” says the halfling child, and Cletus doesn’t correct her. Belor drags the wizard from the lesser throne towards the throne room's entrance.  

Ever since Agnes created a large indent in the floor, the depictions of a man on the walls have been glowing. Very mild occasional shakes of the temple have been happening as well. The portal in the center of the room had grown stronger with the Hag’s death and it expands to take up the entire half of that room, and swallows the wizard. The Fey wilds can now be seen through the portal.  

Agnes starts hitting the room’s pillars with intent to bring down the roof. Cletus picks up the halfling child and sprints through the corridor’s temple entrance. The wizard comes sprinting out of the portal in terror as fast as his old legs can carry him and then collapses completely out of breath. Gracchus and a few others relay the wizard along with them. The heroes hope that having a wizard indebted to them will help remove the magical tracking by Sunfounder. 

Finnick and Belor bring down more pillars and the roof of the throne room is in imminent collapse. As the party sprints through the temple towards the entrance, in hopes that they can escape, the giant cavity underground that is the throne room starts collapsing and all is darkness as the floor, stairs, debris, and the heroes slide and fall.
