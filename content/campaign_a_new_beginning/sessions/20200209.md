After a few of the heroes had gone furniture shopping and Gracchus had mailed a letter, the entire party reconvenes at their new place of residence. The desk and chair are set up near the front door as the secretary’s, Frogface the Enlightened’s, informal office for the plumber’s guild.

A gang of four ruffians enters by the front door and demands the unconditional allegiance of the party, an all too common theme to the party’s increasingly complicated lives. The ruffians are a very large halfling with a great club, a well-armored man with a red hat and an axe, a man devoted to the game headball and carrying a sabre and a whip, and a lady drow not carrying any visible weapons.

The ruffians inform the heroes that the residence that they’re in belongs to the gang with purple gang-signs that owns this side of the avenue. Further, these ruffians are devotees of Father Inverness, a champion of the common people of Caladan’s Outer Circle and devoted to unity and power for even the lowliest. The wisest course according to the ruffians would be to serve with Father Inverness and to submit to his teachings. The heroes aren’t terribly surprised that this “reclaimed” residence granted them by Beckett Sunfounder has hidden and fraught depths of meanings. The heroes claim to be representing Beckett Sunfounder and hearing that name is enough for the ruffians to immediately attack. The heroes had been itching for a fight after several days of activity and the universe seems inclined to oblige.

Goblin Wick the candlemaker cowers in a back room and makes candles. Paw-paw the opossum is equipped with a spoon and continues stirring the soup in the kitchen for the hero’s dinner. Frogface the enlightened stays on the roof entertaining a client. The heroes and the ruffians trade blows, each causing grievous harm to other. The drow lady summons a bat-like fey demon known as a Bucca. Agnes is knocked unconscious and then saved by Belor. The heroes kill the persistent and fanatically loyal ruffians. 

The heroes loot the ruffians and find little of interest beyond a figurine seemingly tied to the now-unaligned Bucca wandering around that they feed soup to and adopt. Belor finds a poorly made and improvised but workable Dwarven Rose. A Dwarven Rose looks like pieces of metal arranged in the shape of rose petals with the slight scent of gunpowder. The large halfling’s great club is salvaged and dubbed “Club Penguin” to reflect the coincidental and odd choice of carvings. A slight and minor bestiary codex is found too, but it’s apparently the Caladan zoo’s pamphlet and only gives high level details on beasts kept by the zoo. In the ruffian’s pockets is a few brochures espousing the virtues and inevitability of Father Inverness’s teachings, as well as his address of 300 steps down Eastman Street is the church above the tannery. Finding these brochures aggravate the heroes because the ruffians claimed to not have any earlier and the ruffians had also said to not create paper trails.

The end of this very long day has crept up and the heroes retire to their respective rooms after sampling the soup by Paw-paw.
