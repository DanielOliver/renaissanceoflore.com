A new day dawns and so begins a new chance our heroes to cause havoc in their adopted city. The heroes rise and shine to find that the Bucca bat has disappeared and the bat figurine is glowing slightly. Remembering their investigations from yesterday, the heroes believe the bat has returned to its realm and waits to be summoned again. Investigating further, the heroes believe that blood is the key to summoning this fey demon.

The heroes find in the washroom a stone basin that Agnes had used before to try to summon the wizard Probabilitor, but instead had just ended up dissolving the spoon into purple water. Recalling some debt that the wizard owes them, the heroes start magically investigating very closely the entire area. A magical scent that hangs in the air like a purple trail for those who can detect magic leads out into the city and the heroes follow it after leaving Goblin Wick and Frogface the Enlightened at their new home. Goblin Wick is given instructions to throw trash from the streets into the sewer grate at the bottom of the house in order to hopefully cause blockages and business for the plumber’s guild sometime.  

The magical trail leads to the servant’s entrance of the wizard guild located in Caladan Town’s Inner City. The heroes gain entrance to the wizard’s guild on the pretense that they bear a gift of the bat figurine for Wizard Probabilitor.  The second floor is where Probabilitor’s apartments are, the second floor being where all the conjurist’s apartments are. Instead of finding the wizard, the heroes find the Vile Barber from the temple that they ruined sitting on the couch. Thinking back, the heroes remember that the wizard went into the fey portal and then came running out a bit later, and that was probably when the identity theft occurred.

The Vile Barber has stolen the identity of the wizard Probabilitor and those who know in the wizard’s guild don’t care so long as the Vile Barber votes with them in the wizard’s guild. The heroes ransack the wizard’s room for trifles and come up with a trident, a magical net that turns into vines upon being thrown, a textbook for “Learn Abyssal in Three Days or Your Demon Back”, a stuffed opossum (which was originally mistaken to be a cat), and a blunderbuss. Further, the heroes extract the knowledge from the Vile Barber that the wizard’s essence is being used to hold the fey portal open by the temple’s sponsor. The Vile Barber hints that he has information on Father Inverness and other things but that his prices are beyond the hero’s budget for now. Mike visits the wizard guild’s third floor which houses enchanters and gets a quote to improve his weapons which is 20 gold per weapon, good for three weeks from time of quote.

Returning briefly to the plumber’s guild headquarters to drop off any excess weight, the heroes find that Anselm Rodric from city planning had dropped off the guild’s license since Beckett Sunfounder had paid the guild’s registration fee and put each of the party member’s names on the charter. Along the way, Dribbler appears, and the heroes offer a rent-free place to park his vendor cart outside the plumber’s guild headquarters.

The heroes recall yesterday’s events and bear a grudge against Father Inverness and his congregation. The heroes turn their feet toward the location in the brochure “300 steps down Eastman Street, the church above the tannery”. In the church, the heroes find a massive tattooed Goliath with a passion for forceful evangelism and a great booming voice “Welcome to the Church of Martial Equality! Where all are equal under the sword, the shield, and the spear!”

A strange measure of common ground is found between the heroes and Father Inverness and the heroes secure his help in four days to mount a rescue for the wizard Probabilitor and to close the fey portal, in return for the hero’s assistance in killing Beckett Sunfounder and for starting a revolution.  Father Inverness is deeply against magic, against abuse of the helpless, against economic disparity, against Beckett Sunfounder or nobles or the Inner City, and against any form of inequality except that determined by martial prowess which makes all equal under the sword and the shield and the spear. Father Inverness also references someone named “the Mule” and how the Mule uses enchanters to kidnap people into slavery (indentured servitude) from many places in order to feed the city’s slave trade, but the heroes don’t seem to pay attention or to care about that. The heroes do not trust Father Inverness but do want his help.

The heroes now turn their eyes to being able to gold by following the rumors of the sewer blockage on the west side of town in the Outer City. The west side of Caladan Town in the Outer City is the temple district. A large brown, shallow lake fills the street outside a few temple buildings, including the Syratic League and Offler the crocodile deity. The heroes visit the six temples bordering this filthy lake and negotiate both an immediate resolution to this problem as well as preventative maintenance measures over the next three months. The heroes then make Agnes clear the blockage in the lake.

The heroes plan out their foray to the fey portal by arranging for Goblin Wick to be absent by going to visit Beckett Sunfounder with the 10% of earned gold of the guild. As well as for Dribbler to be outside the Plumber’s Guild during that day. The heroes instruct Frogface the Enlightened to lie and say that they are merely out on business during that day. And the heroes name the Bucca bat “Andy Lopez Dwyer” to commemorate some fiction they remember.
