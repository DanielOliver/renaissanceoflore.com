The day has come for the hero's planned expedition to the fey portal.

The heroes and Father Inverness travel to the fey portal through the sewer tunnel. Up above the pit's edge, halflings are seen patrolling. These halflings are presumed to be of Kith and they do not answer to inquiries.

The fey portal still lies 10 feet above the floor of the dungeon. Upon request, Father Inverness drops his halberd to use both hands to toss Mike and Cletus into the portal ahead of the rest of the party.

Mike and Cletus are now in the fey realm all by themselves. They see a lone path across a dark swamp. They both instantly do their best to be stealth and they follow the path. The path ends a hundred feet later at a strange clear, mirroring pool of water which keeps itself separate from the surrounding murky quagmire of a swamp. Cletus can tell its full of fey magic. Throwing caution to the wind, Mike jumps into the pool by himself and disappears. Cletus stays in the swamp waiting for the party after failing to restrain Mike.

Father Inverness, Gracchus, Agnes and Belor spend ten minutes collecting rubble from the collapsed temple and build a ramp up to the fey portal. Once they join Cletus in the dark fey swamp, Agnes sticks her arm back through the fey portal and loses her memory of the 30 seconds so far in the fey portal.

The party, minus Mike, are not quiet and they attract the attention of the fey swamp's indigenous tribe. This tribe looks like halflings mixed with goblins with huge flat feet. These creatures are small and very light and using their large feet they may run across the water so long as the water tension isn't broken by anything. The chittering of this tribe is endless and the tribe's reinforcements are endless. Fighting a running tactical retreat, the party runs along the path and dives into the clear pool that Mike had jumped through. The creatures do not follow.

The party sees a large ornate, classical hall filled with mirrors along the wall. Beautiful, ethereal, ghostly partners dance to a waltz sounding from all around. At the end of the hall, Mike stands talking to a beautiful, tall lady dressed in the most lavish gown. In an iron maiden coffin at the end of the hall, the wizard is trapped and his magical essence sustains the fey portal. Mike has been in the Hall of Mirrors for ten minutes longer than anyone else. The fey Queen of Mirrors has offered Mike all he could ever want.

Mike turns to the party and using fey magic tells each of the party members a distinct lie.  To Father Inverness: "This will be a trap for you. The heroes have no intention of fomenting revolution with you." To Agnes: "Belor is enamoured of Dribbler and will steal Dribbler's attention before you may claim Dribbler's devotion." To Belor: "Gracchus and Cletus are scheming against you. You should knock down the supporting pillars like you did in the temple."  To Cletus: "Agnes wants to kill and to stuff your opossum." To Gracchus: "Screw you man."

Father Inverness believes the lie and goes crazy. Agnes and Belor do their best to restrain him and to explain the situation in their favor. Agnes has grappled him and wrestled Father Inverness to the ground with little injury to either. Father Inverness' allergies to cats give Agnes an advantage in this match. Belor starts trying to knock out Father Inverness with the blunt side of an axe.

Twice the fey Queen of Mirrors gave a magical compulsion "Kneel" but it's not quite strong enough a compulsion to force the entire party.

Cletus runs behind a pillar and begins making his way from pillar to pillar towards the fey Queen of Mirrors. Cletus throws ice at her and she makes it disappear and then she steps out from another mirror on the far side of the hall. Cletus's detect magic is fairly sure that she is definitely a real version of herself.

Mike and Gracchus engage in a sword fight in the middle of the hall. The ghostly dancers part and flow around them.
