The party crosses the chasm in the cave to stand between the chasm and the closed doors. Since Father Inverness is still unconcious, they tie him in a rope and swing him across the chasm where he hits his head on the other side, perhaps compounding the head injuries.

In that safe space, the party takes a long rest. Across the chasm may be seen the gelatinous cube sliming around, but it can't reach them. Gracchus falls asleep during his watch and when he awakes, his collection of five severed heads is gone. One head is being eaten by a large spider on the cave wall and the other four heads have left a trail of blood on the floor starting from the satchel and leading to the closed and locked doors. Gracchus is distraught with loss.

On waking, the party single-mindedly focuses on the locked door as the only exit without considering how the escaping wizard Grand Vantage escaped earlier. The voices on the other side of the door claim that the door already opened once during, so why should they open it again?  The party blames the voices for the theft of the heads.

Cletus looks under the door and Misty Steps through immediately. Several orcs look around in surprise. Cletus attempts to open door from the inside against the orcs' strength but isn't strong enough. Belor shouts a warning and places the Dwarven Rose mine against the door. The explosive force blows the door inward, over the head of Cletus who dived to the ground, and through the wall on the other side. The orcs' leader and another orc are unfortunately in the way and will not be heard from again. The new hole in the wall on the other side of the room shows a wine cellar and storeroom.

Gracchus and Justus run up the stairs to find a temple to Tani, Orcish deity of strength. They run outside where Gracchus notes they are in the temple district of Caladan Town before returning to the rest of the party.

Gracchus and party interrogates the two remaining shell-shocked orcs and find out they are part of a sub-cult of Tani that heralds the empire of Gracchus' homeland in a slavish fashion. The temple basement has an effigy of the imperial eagle used on the standards of the army. The party also finds out that the pit in the room houses a Cohlved monster, which looks like a nest of blood vessels. "BLOOD FOR THE Blood GOD!" and "BLOOD!!!" being the only responses the monster will give to polite inquiries.

Not being able to reach a deal and both believing that the other is bluffing, the party's negotiations with Probabilitor take a dark turn. Probabilitor is beheaded, his body thrown into the Cohlved pit and his head given to Gracchus.

The party determines that Father Inverness has some memory loss and doesn't remember the revelation of betrayal in the fey realm. Father Inverness is untied and instead of his normal ranting about his Church of Martial Equality, he rants about his Church of Financial Peace. Cletus points Father Inverness in the opposite direction of his church at the Tannery and lets him loose.

On their walk home, the party accosts a street rat that attempts to pickpocket them. The guards would have gotten involved but Agnes bribes the child.

Later on their walk home, the party walks by an orphanage having problems with sewage backing up. That same street rat is in the line of kids waiting outside the affected area. Upon inquiry, the party finds out there's a murder investigation going on and the city detectives are involved. Remnants of chopped up people have clogged sewage lines causing a backup. The guard offers one piece of gold for every person's remains recovered and the Plumbers Guild gets to work. The remnants of the people are revealed to be the same people that the party killed inside the Plumber's Guild some days ago.

Upon receiving a note from the detectives payable at the city hall, the party goes there to discover the town hall is closed on Sundays.

The party returns to the Plumber's Guild office to find Frogface the Enlightened isn't at the front desk, but Goblin Wick is. Goblin Wick has made a lot of candles, both earwax and not, in the three days they were gone. Goblin Wick says that Beckett Sunfounder will want to talk to them. The little Goblin is also very rude.

With very fast reflexes, Belor catches Mike's head as it rolls down the stairs from upstairs. The front door is closed, and upon release, the head keeps knocking into the front door as it tries to roll out.
