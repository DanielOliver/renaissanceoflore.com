The time is just past midday. The crew waits on the messenger from Beckett to inform them that a magical trace is gone. One or two plan out the Plumber's Guild mockumentary. Gracchus starts insulting Pawpaw by calling him a mongoose. Agnes looks on the roof and finds bloody brown fur with red fabric made from the coats of Marcone Monkeys. These monkeys are imported and from near her homeland.

Goblin Wick bursts in the door, the little madman. Goblin Wick attempts to kill the party via candle magic. The candles scattered around the plumbers guild's main room, that were made by Goblin Wick, start coming to life. Humanoids made from translucent wax with a candle's wick at the center.

The party battles Goblin Wick and his candle wickermen. Goblin Wick sings horrible songs "The Candle Man can", "I'm a little Goblin short and stout, here is my candle don't blow it out", "I'm the wax man!", and much worse. The party decides that singing music can help battle this fearsome foe and burst into song. Justus finishes Goblin Wick's long delayed demise, and they find that Goblin Wick himself melts because he is formed of wax.

The party is enraged that Beckett would try to kill them. They happen to know that Goblin Wick's original shop was on Drury Lane, a small Goblin town with Caladan Town. Drury Lane holds a Goblin butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, and a muffin goblin. Cletus makes candles from Goblin Wick's remains and salvages a signet ring.

Agnes forges a letter from Goblin Wick without having seen Goblin Wick's handwriting or evidence of literary skill, and signs it with wax emblem from the signet ring. This letter says that Goblin Wick is chasing the party and the hunt is still on. "Tracking through sewers."

Cletus and a few others ransack the plumber's guild in an effort to make it look like they had a fight.  Agnes explores the possibility of going to the Fey Queen "Does the Fey queen want better servants?"

In the end, Cletus and Agnes go secretly to Father Inverness' church above the tannery. Cletus sees a lady Yuan-Ti from Omis on stage with Father Inverness, but takes little note. Cletus does address the congregation and riles them up as revolutionaries. Father Inverness and Cletus make a covenant to rid the world of Beckett Sunfounder.
